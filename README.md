# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This is where I will be sharing my solutions for each day's challenge from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event that provides daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. It's a fun way to practice coding, problem-solving, and learn new programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

Each day's solution will be organized in its own folder following this structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ day01
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ day02
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
...
```

- **`main.ts`**: Solution for part 1 and part 2 of the day's challenge.
- **`input.txt`**: Input data for the challenge.
- **`README.md`**: Optional notes or explanations for the day's challenge.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code.git
   cd advent-of-code
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired day's folder:

   ```bash
   cd day01
   ```

3. Run the TypeScript scripts using Deno:

   ```bash
   deno run --allow-read main.ts
   ```

## Tools and Languages

I'm solving the challenges using:

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript with [Deno](https://deno.land/).
- **Libraries**: I may use standard Deno modules or third-party libraries if necessary.
